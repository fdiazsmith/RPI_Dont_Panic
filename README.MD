## Raspberry Pi Setup ðŸ”§

How to prepare and setup a Raspberry Pi for this project:

1. Download the latest version of [Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) and flash your micro SD card with [Etcher](https://etcher.io/)

2. Paste and edit boot files:
```
<YOURCOMPUTER>/
â”œâ”€â”€ boot/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config.txt     <-- in a new line add: dtoverlay=dwc2
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ cmdline.txt    <-- after rootwait add a space and paste: modules-load=dwc2,g_ether
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ .
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ .       OTHER FILES OMITTED
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ .
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ssh                     <-- add this one
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ wpa_supplicant.conf     <-- edit and add this one
```

3. In terminal ssh into the pi: ```sudo ssh pi@raspberrypi.local```<br>*Default password is 'raspberry'. To change password use the `passwd` command*

4. Get your PI up to speed:
```
sudo curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fdiazsmith/basic_PI/master/basic_setup.sh -o basic_setup.sh && bash basic_setup.sh && rm basic_setup.sh
```
> This [post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5735666/execute-bash-script-from-url) explains how to download and execute a bash script....
here we should have a bash file that you can curl and do everything else
  * update and upgrade
  * install git
  * install basic vimrc
  * install netatalk
  * other libraries that we want?
  * node ?
  * reboot

That is it!
